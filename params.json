{"name":"Elmah SQL Server Initializer","tagline":"Automatically creates an Elmah database on SQL Server using Entity Framework migrations.","body":"**_This project is very young! Please do raise any issues that you find via GitHub and I will try and resolve them._**\r\n\r\n#### Installation\r\n\r\nThis project is available as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Elmah.SqlServer.EFInitializer/).\r\nIt can be installed from the Visual Studio Package Manager Console using `Install-Package Elmah.SqlServer.EFInitializer`.\r\n\r\n#### Configuration\r\n\r\nBy default the database will be created using the `DefaultConnection` connection string.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to use a different connection string, you should declare a named string in the `connectionStrings` section of `Web.config` and edit the `connectionStringName` attribute on the `elmah / errorLog` configuration element. For example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<configuration>\r\n  <!-- Other configuration omitted -->\r\n  <connectionStrings>\r\n    <add name=\"MyElmahConnection\"\r\n         connectionString=\"Data Source=(local);Initial Catalog=MyElmah;Integrated Security=True;\"\r\n         providerName=\"System.Data.SqlClient\" />\r\n  </connectionStrings>\r\n  <elmah>\r\n    <errorLog type=\"Elmah.SqlErrorLog, Elmah\" \r\n              connectionStringName=\"MyElmahConnection\" />\r\n  </elmah>\r\n</configuration>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Usage note\r\n\r\nThe intent of this package is _only_ to automate the creation of a backing SQL Server database for Elmah and provide enough configuration to do the basic logging. Errors will be logged to the database, but you will also need to install something like the main [Elmah](https://www.nuget.org/packages/elmah/) package or [Elmah.MVC](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Elmah.MVC/) to view them within the site.\r\n\r\n#### Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nCredit must go to the creators of [Elmah.SqlServer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/elmah.sqlserver/1.2.0), the SQL from that project is what I used for the migrations.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
